# Items
## What are World Items?
**World Items** (or **Items** for short) represent physical objects in the world of your TTRPG—anything from a worn-out sword to a mysterious family heirloom.

At their simplest, an item is just a **name** and a **description**. For example:

> **Medallion**
> _A medallion of the Mytril family. This medallion is one of the few that exist, and anyone who has one is considered part of the bloodline._

That’s it! But when you need the item to actually _do_ something—like deal damage, store ammo, or be equipped—you can extend it with [item modules](#Adding%20Details%20with%20Modules).

### Adding Details with Modules

**Item Modules** are what give items more functionality. Just like [character entities](../../entities/README), items start simple—with a name and a description—but can be extended using modules to define what they actually _do_.

Modules let you build the exact item you need:

- Want a **sword**? Add a **Damage** module to show how much it hits for.
- Turning it into a **bow**? Add the **Range** module to know how far it can reach.
- Making a **magical artefact**? Attach modules for **Spells**, **Stat Boosts**, or even **Durability** if it wears out with use.

The idea is to keep things flexible:

- **Simple items** stay lightweight, with just the basics.
- **Complex items** can still have all of it's information using multiple modules.
