## What are World Mechanics?
**World Mechanics** (or **Game Mechanics**) are the foundational systems that define how things _work_ in a TTRPG world. These mechanics aren’t tied to any [entity](../../entities/README.md) or [item](../items/README.md)—instead, they provide the rules and tools that drive gameplay at a global level.

Some examples include:

- **Dice** – Handle randomness, rolls, and probability. Whether it’s a d20 skill check or rolling for damage, dice are central to most TTRPG systems.
- **Effects** – Temporary or ongoing conditions that change how characters or items behave. Think buffs and debuffs—like strengthening, slowness—or status effects—like stunned or blessed.

As the system grows, more general-purpose mechanics will be added—things like turn order systems, reaction handling, initiative trackers, and other rules that help run the game smoothly, no matter what kind of game you're playing.

The goal of **World Mechanics** is to give you flexible, reusable systems that can be shared across all game systems—so you can focus more on storytelling and gameplay, and less on reinventing the dice roller.
