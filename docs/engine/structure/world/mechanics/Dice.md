# Dice Mechanic

The **Dice Mechanic** defines the behaviour of a single die type—such as a `d6`, `d8`, or `d20`. It acts as the base unit for all dice rolling across the system, used by [DiceSets](DiceSet.md), abilities, items, and more.

These **Dice** are used to decide the fate of some aspects of the game like damage, healing, ability checks, etc.

## What it includes:

- **Sides** – How many faces the die has (e.g. `6` for a `d6`)
- **Die Type** (*optional*) – The label for the die (e.g. `d4`, `d6`, `d10`, `d20` or `Chaos Dice`). If none is provided, defaults to `"dN"` where `N` is the number of sides.

## Mechanics:

- **Roll die** - Simulate a die roll of the dice type.
