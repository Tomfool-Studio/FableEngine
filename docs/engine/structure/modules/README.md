# Modules
## What are Modules?

**Modules** are the pieces that make up an [entity](../entities/README). Each one handles a specific part of what a character is or does—like how much health it has, how fast it moves, or what items it carries.

Why break it all into modules? Because flexibility and full customization is the goal.

With this setup:

- **Players** can build anything they imagine. Whether it’s a classic adventurer, a weird hybrid creature, or something totally unexpected—you only add the modules you need.

- **DMs** can create everything from fully fleshed-out NPCs to quick, lightweight characters that only include a name, a short description, or maybe an inventory to represent a shop.


You don’t have to commit to big, complex builds every time. Want to make a bartender with just a name and a backstory? Easy. Need a blacksmith whose inventory shows what’s in their store? Just plug in an inventory module.

This modular system is all about giving you control. Add only what matters, leave out the rest—and your entities stay simple, clear, and exactly as detailed as you need them to be.
