# Text Module
The **Text Module** is used to store any piece of text. It’s perfect for things like character backstories, item flavour text, personality notes, or lore descriptions—basically, anything that’s purely narrative or adicional information.

This module lets you attach meaningful written content to an entity or item without adding mechanical rules.

### What it includes:

- **Name** – A label for what the text represents (e.g. `"Backstory"`, `"Personality"`, `"Item Description"`).
- **Text** – The actual content in plain text.

> Note: The name of the entity/item itself is part of it's base structure and should not be included with this module.
