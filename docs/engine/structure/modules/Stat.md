# Stat Module
The **Stat Module** is used to represent any simple named numerical value an [entity](../entities/README.md) might have. It's perfect for things like AC, skill bonuses, saving throws, or any custom attribute relevant to your game.

This module keeps things flexible and lightweight—great for when you just need to track a value without attaching extra logic or rules.

## What it includes:

- **Name** – A label for what the stat represents (e.g. `"AC"`, `"Perception"`, `"Strength Save"`)
- **Value** – A number tied to that stat, such as a flat value (`15`) or a modifier (`+4`, `-1`)
